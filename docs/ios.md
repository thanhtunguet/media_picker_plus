## Developer Configuration Notes

### Required Permissions
Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<!-- Camera and microphone permissions -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to capture photos and videos</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access to record audio with videos</string>

<!-- Photo library permission -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to select images and videos</string>

<!-- Limited photo library access (iOS 14+) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to save processed media</string>
</xml>

### iOS Version Support
Minimum deployment target in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj`:
```
IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 12.0
```

### Privacy Manifest (iOS 17+)
The plugin includes a privacy manifest in `ios/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` documenting:
- Camera API usage
- Photo library API usage
- Microphone API usage
- File system access patterns

### Build Configuration
No additional build settings required. The plugin automatically:
- Configures required frameworks
- Sets up proper Swift version compatibility
- Handles iOS version availability checks

## Performance Characteristics

### Image Processing
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-3x image size during processing (Core Graphics optimization)
- **Processing Time**: <500ms for typical photos on modern devices
- **Quality**: Lossless operations until final compression
- **Thread Safety**: Main thread operations for UI, background for processing

### Video Processing
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate (AVFoundation manages video memory efficiently)
- **Processing Time**: 1-5s per minute of video (device dependent)
- **Export Quality**: Maintains high quality with configurable compression
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Leverages iOS video encoding hardware

### Permission Handling
- **Response Time**: Immediate for cached permissions, 1-2s for new requests

- **Caching**: Proper permission state caching and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify Info.plist entries are present and descriptive
- Check for proper permission request timing
- Ensure app is not calling APIs before permissions granted
- Use plugin's built-in permission check methods
