<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs camera access to capture photos and videos</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access to record audio with videos</string>

<!-- Photo library access (if using programmatic access) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs photo library access to manage photos</string>
```

### macOS Version Support
Minimum deployment target in `macos/Runner.xcodeproj`:
```
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.14
```

**Version-specific Features:**
- **macOS 14.0+**: Continuity Camera support
- **macOS 11.0+**: UTType file filtering, enhanced permissions
- **macOS 10.14+**: Basic AVFoundation functionality

### Sandboxing Configuration
For App Store distribution, update `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`:

```xml
<!-- Camera and microphone access -->
<key>com.apple.security.device.camera</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.device.microphone</key>
<true/>

<!-- File system access for user-selected files -->
<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
<true/>

<!-- Temporary directory access -->
<key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-write</key>
<array>
    <string>/private/tmp/</string>
</array>
```

### Build Configuration
Update `macos/Runner.xcodeproj` build settings:

```xcconfig
ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = YES
ENABLE_USER_SELECTED_FILES = YES
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = [Your Team ID]
```

## Performance Characteristics

### File Operations
- **NSOpenPanel**: Native performance, good user experience
- **File Copying**: Basic I/O performance
- **Multiple Selection**: Handles moderate file counts well

### Camera Operations
- **Device Discovery**: Fast for built-in cameras, slower for Continuity Camera
- **Photo Capture**: Good performance, 1-3 second delay
- **Video Recording**: Acceptable performance with auto-stop

### Processing Performance
- **Image Processing**: Moderate performance using NSImage/Core Graphics
- **Video Processing**: Slower than iOS due to less optimization
- **Memory Usage**: Higher than mobile platforms

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Camera Issues
- **Long Initialization**: Continuity Camera can take 5-10 seconds to initialize
- **Auto-Recording**: No interactive stop control for video recording
- **Preview Missing**: No live camera preview for user feedback
- **Multiple Cameras**: Basic support, no camera switching UI

### Processing Limitations
- **Synchronous Operations**: Blocking UI during processing
- **Memory Usage**: High memory consumption for large files
- **Format Support**: Limited output format options
- **Quality Control**: Basic compression settings only

### System Integration
- **Sandbox Restrictions**: Limited file system access outside user selection
- **Background Processing**: No background task support
- **Energy Efficiency**: Not optimized for battery usage
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Limited use of GPU acceleration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify Info.plist entries are complete
- Check System Preferences > Security & Privacy settings
- Ensure proper entitlements for sandboxed apps
- Test permission prompts in development builds

#### Camera Access Failures
- Check for multiple apps using camera simultaneously
- Verify camera hardware availability
- Test with different camera types (built-in vs. external)
- Monitor for Continuity Camera connectivity issues

#### File Access Issues
- Ensure NSOpenPanel is used for user file selection
- Check sandboxing entitlements for file access
- Verify temporary directory permissions
- Handle security-scoped bookmarks properly

#### Performance Problems
- Monitor memory usage during processing
- Check for memory leaks in capture sessions
- Profile video processing operations
- Optimize for specific macOS versions

### Debug Information
Enable detailed logging by monitoring:
- Console output for plugin debug messages
- AVFoundation error domains and codes
- NSOpenPanel user cancellation events
- Memory pressure and performance metrics

## Architecture Notes

### File Access Strategy
- **User-Selected Files**: NSOpenPanel provides proper sandboxing compliance
- **Temporary Files**: Use NSTemporaryDirectory() for processed media
- **Security-Scoped Resources**: Minimal usage, prefer copying to temp directory
- **Cleanup**: Manual temporary file management required

### Camera Session Management
- **Single Session**: One AVCaptureSession at a time to avoid conflicts
- **Proper Cleanup**: Stop sessions and release delegates to prevent memory leaks
- **Timeout Handling**: Auto-timeout for failed operations
- **Device Selection**: Prioritize newer camera types when available

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: UI operations, permission dialogs, delegate callbacks
- **Background Queues**: File I/O, processing operations
- **Synchronization**: DispatchSemaphore for async-to-sync bridging
- **Memory Management**: ARC with manual session cleanup

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Testing
- File selection and filtering logic
- Permission state management
- Basic image processing operations
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Testing
