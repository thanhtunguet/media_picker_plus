# TODO Session History - Media Picker Plus

## Session Summary (2025-07-18)

### Completed Tasks ✅
1. **Create interactive cropping UI widget for manual crop selection** - Comprehensive CropUI widget with draggable handles
2. **Implement crop UI integration in platform implementations** - Added processImage method to Android/iOS native code
3. **Add crop UI demonstration to example project** - Enhanced example app with interactive crop demo
4. **Update documentation with interactive cropping feature** - Added crop sections to README and documentation
5. **Test interactive cropping UI across platforms** - Verified functionality on Android and iOS
6. **Fix infinite size rendering issue in CropWidget** - Resolved RenderCustomPaint infinite size errors
7. **Implement ratio-based movement for proper gesture tracking** - Fixed gesture precision issues
8. **Fix interactive cropping to return processed image instead of original** - Corrected crop processing pipeline
9. **Add minimum crop area constraints to prevent scale=0 crash** - Prevented InteractiveViewer scale assertion errors
10. **Fix ArgumentError(0.1) by implementing 30% minimum crop size based on smaller screen edge** - Dynamic minimum size calculation
11. **Add zoom functionality when crop selector reaches minimum size** - Enhanced zoom support up to 5x when at minimum

### Key Achievements
- **Interactive Cropping System**: Fully functional with native processing
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed all reported crashes and UI issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Throttled callbacks, cached paint objects
- **User Experience**: Added visual feedback and zoom capabilities
- **Cross-Platform**: Working on Android and iOS with native processing

### Technical Improvements
- Normalized coordinate system (0.0-1.0) for cross-platform compatibility
- Ratio-based gesture tracking for precise movement
- Multi-layer validation with comprehensive error handling
- Dynamic minimum size calculation based on screen dimensions
- Enhanced zoom functionality with visual indicators

## Technical Notes for Next Session

### Important Files to Review
- `lib/crop_ui.dart` - Main interactive cropping implementation
- `lib/crop_options.dart` - Crop configuration API
- `lib/crop_helper.dart` - Crop workflow utilities
- `android/src/main/kotlin/info/thanhtunguet/media_picker_plus/MediaPickerPlusPlugin.kt` - Android native processing
- `ios/Classes/MediaPickerPlusPlugin.swift` - iOS native processing

### Key Implementation Details
- **Minimum Crop Size**: 30% of smaller screen edge (width for portrait, height for landscape)
- **Zoom Functionality**: Dynamic maxScale (5x when at minimum size, 3x otherwise)
- **Coordinate System**: Normalized 0.0-1.0 coordinates for cross-platform compatibility
- **Gesture Tracking**: Ratio-based movement calculations for precise UI interaction
- **Performance**: Throttled callbacks (16ms), cached paint objects, RepaintBoundary

### Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ ArgumentError(0.1) with minimum size constraints
- ✅ Scale assertion crashes (scale != 0.0)
- ✅ Infinite size rendering errors
- ✅ Gesture tracking precision issues
- ✅ Original image returned instead of processed crop

### Development Environment
- Flutter SDK: Latest stable
- Platforms: Android (working), iOS (working), macOS (minimal), Web (minimal)
- Testing: Example app with comprehensive crop demo
- Build Status: All changes compile successfully

## Session Continuation Guide

### Starting Next Session
1. Review the PROJECT_PLAN.md for overall project roadmap
2. Check TODO_SESSION_HISTORY.md for completed tasks and next priorities
3. Review CLAUDE.md for current project status and guidelines
4. Begin with highest priority uncompleted tasks

### Context for AI Assistant
- This is a Flutter plugin for media picking with advanced processing
- Interactive cropping system is complete and working
- Focus should be on macOS/Web implementation or video cropping
- All Android/iOS functionality is working and tested
- Performance and user experience are key priorities
